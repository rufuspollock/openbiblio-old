    <h2>Welcome to ${c.site_title}</h2>
    <p>The ${c.site_title} service is an <strong><a
        href="http://opendefinition.org/">open</a> catalogue of cultural
      works</strong> that grew out of the <a
      href="http://www.publicdomainworks.net/">Public Domain Works</a> project
    which started in 2005 and is still running today.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Bibliographica software</strong> that powers this site is
    <strong>open-source</strong> and designed <strong>for
      others to use</strong>. Moreover, different bibliographica instances can
    co-operatively share information. Other significant features include
    <strong>native RDF support</strong>,
    <strong>FRBR-like domain model</strong>, and <strong>wiki-like recording of
      every change</strong>. <a
      href="url('about')">Find out more &raquo;</a>.</p>

    <p>There are currently <strong>${c.person_total} persons, ${c.item_total} items and ${c.work_total} works</strong> in the database.</p>
